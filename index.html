<br><i>Bodily Dreams</i> Workshop with Jenny Laiwint
<br>in association with the exhibition <b><A HREF="pages/dreams.html" style="color:black"> places where sounds turn to dreams...</A></b>
<br>November 24, 2:30-4:30pm

<p>This workshop will take place at Hearth, located near the corner of Bathurst & Ulster, on Wednesday November 24th from 2:30-4:30pm. 

<p>Participants are encouraged to dress prepared for the weather. We ask that all participants be prepared to show proof of vaccination and/or valid exemption prior to the start of the workshop, to ensure the safety of all participants and the artist. An email confirming your participation will be sent to all participants prior to the workshop. Participants signing up should be available for the duration of the workshop. 

<p>Workshop description: 
<br>Artist Jennifer Laiwint’s interactive workshop forges connections between bodily rhythms and feeling states and explores the ways that these can be creatively translated through movement, sound, drawing and creative visualizations. What happens to our physical rhythms when we attempt to overcome fear or enter a meditative trance? How can the interpretation of these tempos and their variations be a point of entry into movement creation, speculative storytelling and beat making? 

<p>Inspired by footage of cardiologist Dr. John Grammer demonstrating different arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) through simple movements, Laiwint adapts Grammar’s embodied method to develop an approach to listening and imagining bodily beats that individuals at all levels of experience can engage. For this workshop, internal listening forms the basis for relational dance-based games, drawing exercises and beat making. Since Covid-19, Laiwint has developed alternate listening activities based on imagining and touching sounds and pulses. These exercises will focus on both the rhythmic, visual and emotional dimensions of bodily sounds. Participants will engage in different modes of translation based on what is heard when listening to the body and their imaginations to generate movement, recorded sound, and sharing what might be found in a warehouse rave, a mystical sanctuary or an experimental research lab.

<p>Please join us for the opening reception of our final exhibition of the season, curated by our curatorial incubator recipient, Dhvani Ramanujam!

<p><i>places where sounds turn to dreams...</i> is a group exhibition that focuses on artists that engage with sonic-worldmaking in their practices. Through a series of aural mediations, landscapes, and ecologies, the works on display ask viewers to consider how sound helps us locate the cracks and leaks in time and space, playing with themes of speculation, language, and memory.

<p>Join us Friday September 17th 5-8pm for the opening day. Regular Gallery Hours are Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 12-4, and by appointment. 

<p><i>Zona de Sacrificio</i> (Sacrifice Zone) is a solo exhibition by artist and researcher Soledad Fátima Muñoz featuring a selection of textiles and a short film.

<p><i>Zona de Sacrificio</i> references an ongoing process of political intervention orchestrated by North American and European governments in order to profit from resource extraction globally, leaving impacted areas permanently damaged by heavy environmental alterations and economic divestment. With works referencing events related to the history of neoliberal intervention in Chile, as well as the ongoing nature of these systemic abuses, Zona de Sacrificio aims to raise awareness of Canada’s role in global resource exploitation, and draw attention to Chile’s current context, where political prisoners still await trial for involvement in a contemporary movement to change the constitution implemented by Augusto Pinochet’s american-backed military dictatorship (1973-1990).

<p>Joy is sometimes fleeting and nebulous. It is sometimes outlined or overshadowed by grief, sorrow, and deep loneliness. Yet, it continues to glimmer in small ways, especially powerful when nurtured through community care. In the spirit of precarious joy, a joy that is obtained by a communal asking, the artists in this exhibition activate joy as resistance, joy as radical acts.

<p>Produced by Project 40 Collective, "Precarious Joy" is our final volume of LooseLeaf Magazine in 3D form. This interdisciplinary group exhibition features artists Fong Ki Wan, Jana Ghalayini, Khanh Tudo, L Akhter, Qirou Yang, Ramolen Laruan, Rice Water Collective (Florence Yee & Arezu Salamzadeh), Sanna Wani, Tommy Truong, with an exhibition essay from atif m. khan.
Precarious Joy is funded by the Toronto Arts Council.

<p>Featuring work by Nabil Azab, Rixt de Boer, and Christian Vistan, Written in Water offers artworks that consider the processes of memory, recollection, and forgetting. 

	<p>Aristotle distinguishes memory and remembering by assigning pathos to the former and attributing deliberate action to the latter. At the heart of this distinction we might discern the nascent refutation of a linear reading of time, instead understanding the two as working radially to interpret events and experiences. The artists in this exhibition propose misalignments and fallibility within experiences of remembering. The authority of the past desanctified into phantasmata, what feels familiar also dapples in sway. A glint, a glyph, gripping onto the sticky nodes of associations. By and by, memory’s finger curls within the nook. A bed of moss and weeds envelop its trace.

<p>In “Ain El Karma”, a song originally written and performed in the early 1900s, poet and singer Aissa Djarmouni connects the act of tattooing to the land he wrote of, describing the puncturing of the skin, “Dot by dot like a baby gazelle grazing in the plain of the Olive River”. 

<p>The lasting popularity of this lyric links the once common practice of tattooing to the present; giving life and persistence to a tradition that, with the criminalizing of nomadic ways of being and the growing stigma associated with tattooing, is no longer widely performed in the region. 

<p>Mehran Mafi Bordbar, Mélika Hashemi and Iman Lahroussi draw from tattoo cultures across Iran and the Maghreb to explore borders, gender, faith, and the future—especially futures which demand the rejection of binaries, static history, and erasure.

<p>(Re)membering and (Re)imagining: the Joyous Star Peoples of Turtle Island is a solo exhibition at Hearth Garage by Natalie King addressing joy, love, power, reclamation and the (re)imagining of Anishinaabe futures. Reflecting on Anishinaabe stories of the stars and the practice of oral storytelling, King visualises the act of embarking on ancestor-to-ancestor conversations that exist within and beyond the current physical plane, queering real and imagined conversations of past and future.

<p>Natalie King (she/her) is a queer interdisciplinary Anishinaabe artist, facilitator and member of Timiskaming First Nation. King's multidisciplinary arts practice includes video, painting, sculpture and installation as well as community engagement, curation and arts administration.

<i><p>Deeply connected to human projections and aspirations, the Moon is subject to an array of encounters – from personal wonder to our collective histories, of bodies of water and flesh.
Following the line between waking hours and sleep, two subterranean rooms refract along the asymmetrical warp of the scrying bowl. Step towards inversion or clarity; there are still pools to welcome you near the cyclical turn of seasons pinned to canvas. Choose another way to find yourself within a labyrinthine corridor, following scorched bronze and quilts in rest. These twin chambers hinge on the reading room, a restful moth-light library; we invite you to sit a spell by the glow.</p></i>

<p><img src="../img/SLA_6.jpg" style="width:65%;">

<p>We’re excited to share the newest edition of our City Water broadside, <i>Shadow Land Acknowledgment”</i>, a collaboration between Cody Caetano and Yan Wen Chang.⁣
⁣
<p>"The idea and conceptual site of the Shadow Land comes from writer and traditional teacher Lee Maracle (Sto:lo), who in the past has taught it as “the space between the living and the dead where terrible things can be looked at.” ⁣
⁣
<p>In “Shadow Land Acknowledgement,” Yan Wen Chang and Cody Caetano torque a political genre to confront the myopia and cognitive dissonance of the city’s political shakers. ⁣⁣
⁣
<p>B&W prints of this edition, as pictured, are available for free/by donation, while the edition of 20 originals is for sale for $45 each. <b>For inquiries please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com. All proceeds from this broadside will go to Encampment Support Network Toronto.</b>

	<br>Travellers: A New Installation by Jordan Elliot Prosser</span>
	<p>January 16th - February 16th, 2021

<p>Over the Christmas season, Jordan Elliott Prosser has recycled material from a recent exhibition to transform Hearth into a diorama, inviting visitors to peer into a sculptural tableau made from Prosser’s childhood objects . Travellers is conceived in the image of the Christian trope of a redemptive interior found in representations of the nativity and persisting in western literature (Dickens), cinema (Spielberg), and visual art (Duchamp).

<p>This exhibition is intended to be viewed from Hearth’s window, and is available for viewing at any time. It is best viewed after the sun has set on a snowy day. We are located on Ulster St. just east of Three Star Variety (621 Bathurst, Toronto, ON, M5S 2R2). For more information, see hearthgarage.com or contact us at hearthgarage@gmail.com.
