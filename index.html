<p>Hearth is excited to present <i></i>A Walking Start</i>, a solo exhibition of quilts by Jillian Tamaki. Spanning from 2010-present, the quilts on view feature explorations in abstraction as well as embroidery drawing on Tamaki’s deep relationship to the visual language of comics and illustration. 

<br><br>Resulting in part from an interest in finding time and space for creative pursuits away from the pressures of instrumentalizing art towards profit, we are deeply grateful to the artist for the chance to present these rarely seen works. We hope you can join us!

<br><br>Jillian Tamaki is a New York Times bestselling illustrator, cartoonist, and teacher who makes books for people of all different ages–from picture books to YA comics to graphic novels. She is the co-creator, with her cousin Mariko Tamaki, of This One Summer, which won a Caldecott Honor and Printz Award. Her latest book Roaming, also co-created with Mariko, was published in Fall 2023. She lives in Toronto, Canada.

<br>Tristan Sauer, Lauren Warrington, Soft Turns, Megan Feheley, Hiba Ali
<br>Curated by Philip Leonard Ocampo and Sameen Mahboubi
<br>July 11 - August 10, 2024

<p>Hearth is thrilled to announce <i></i>A phosphene rifts</i>, a new exhibition of outdoor VR activations in partnership with VECTOR Festival 2024.

<p>Exploring augmented reality’s ability to expand upon physical perceptions of the real world with objects and assets only perceivable through a digital medium, “A phosphene rifts” explores the mutant materiality and particular tangibilities in the spontaneous creation unique to AR. Rather than bridging, could probing the gap between the corporeal world and the ‘virtual’ allow the botanic and animal to tap into a zone outside of linear spacetime? There are rifts to be deepend in what we make of the ‘real’ world, where moments of curiosity, grief, survival, and healing suddenly emerge. Here, the light of these phenomena is interpreted through the lenses of our trusty smartphones before entering our eyes.

<p><i></i>New Strata: Five Years</i> re-visits the practices of four artists featured in our inaugural 2019 exhibition. As we launch a new permanent space, it only felt right to gather with Misbah Ahmed, Shannon Garden-Smith, Andrew Harding, and Cadence Planthara five years after our initial collaboration.

In returning to this theme, we return to stratification’s relationship with time. We enter a recursive process of reflection: a spiral that deviates from itself each time it circles back. We hope you can join us April 27, 7-10PM for another experiment in housewarming.

For a month we called SPACEMAKER II our home, and here we enunciate in the voice of The Channeller— one who takes the middle path between total reception of environmental energy and the hermetic production of internal power. This arrangement beckons our dwelling’s intuitive moments, be it through plumbing the depths of the body’s internal landscapes, navigating the grief architecture of the avant-city, or reconciling with the possibility of non-human afterlife.

 <p>Layers of drawing, photographs, and resin fuse source material with extrapolated vision, coalescing in new forms. Inspired in part by site visits exploring the Dundas Museum’s collection and architecture, these works reconfigure and reimagine its contents in a sensorial reflection of accumulation.
Through the process of collage, both artists point their interest towards ideas of value, preservation, and questions of description as they relate to objecthood and material histories. Using compositional structures and devices intrinsic to museum displays, the artists re-articulate frames, tabletops, and glass cases as a shared visual language. 29 Games for Parties offers a recasting of the archive as a subjective, and sensory endeavour.

<p>Artist Bios:
<br>Holly Fedida is an artist invested in the intimacies of observation and the objects we hold close. Working with painting and drawing, she aims to imagine different possibilities for the still-life genre, creating pictures in which objects can become subjects: taking on the roles of active protagonists. Holly holds a BFA in Painting and Drawing from Concordia University. She currently lives and works in Tkaronto/Toronto.
<p>Born in Sarnia, Ontario, Paula McLean received a Bachelor of Fine Art in Studio Art from Concordia University in 2017 and a Master of Fine Art at the University of Waterloo in 2019. As an interdisciplinary artist, she is interested in the interplay (as well as synthesis) between subject and object as it relates to ideas of memory, mimicry, entropy, and meaning. She currently lives and works in Tkaronto/Toronto.

<br><i>Bodily Dreams</i> Workshop with Jenny Laiwint
<br>in association with the exhibition <b><A HREF="pages/dreams.html" style="color:black"> places where sounds turn to dreams...</A></b>
<br>November 24, 2:30-4:30pm

<p>This workshop will take place at Hearth, located near the corner of Bathurst & Ulster, on Wednesday November 24th from 2:30-4:30pm. 

<p>Participants are encouraged to dress prepared for the weather. We ask that all participants be prepared to show proof of vaccination and/or valid exemption prior to the start of the workshop, to ensure the safety of all participants and the artist. An email confirming your participation will be sent to all participants prior to the workshop. Participants signing up should be available for the duration of the workshop. 

<p>Workshop description: 
<br>Artist Jennifer Laiwint’s interactive workshop forges connections between bodily rhythms and feeling states and explores the ways that these can be creatively translated through movement, sound, drawing and creative visualizations. What happens to our physical rhythms when we attempt to overcome fear or enter a meditative trance? How can the interpretation of these tempos and their variations be a point of entry into movement creation, speculative storytelling and beat making?

<p>Please join us for the opening reception of our final exhibition of the season, curated by our curatorial incubator recipient, Dhvani Ramanujam!

<p><i>places where sounds turn to dreams...</i> is a group exhibition that focuses on artists that engage with sonic-worldmaking in their practices. Through a series of aural mediations, landscapes, and ecologies, the works on display ask viewers to consider how sound helps us locate the cracks and leaks in time and space, playing with themes of speculation, language, and memory.

<p>Join us Friday September 17th 5-8pm for the opening day. Regular Gallery Hours are Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 12-4, and by appointment. 

<p><i>Zona de Sacrificio</i> (Sacrifice Zone) is a solo exhibition by artist and researcher Soledad Fátima Muñoz featuring a selection of textiles and a short film.

<p><i>Zona de Sacrificio</i> references an ongoing process of political intervention orchestrated by North American and European governments in order to profit from resource extraction globally, leaving impacted areas permanently damaged by heavy environmental alterations and economic divestment. With works referencing events related to the history of neoliberal intervention in Chile, as well as the ongoing nature of these systemic abuses, Zona de Sacrificio aims to raise awareness of Canada’s role in global resource exploitation, and draw attention to Chile’s current context, where political prisoners still await trial for involvement in a contemporary movement to change the constitution implemented by Augusto Pinochet’s american-backed military dictatorship (1973-1990).

<p>Joy is sometimes fleeting and nebulous. It is sometimes outlined or overshadowed by grief, sorrow, and deep loneliness. Yet, it continues to glimmer in small ways, especially powerful when nurtured through community care. In the spirit of precarious joy, a joy that is obtained by a communal asking, the artists in this exhibition activate joy as resistance, joy as radical acts.

<p>Produced by Project 40 Collective, "Precarious Joy" is our final volume of LooseLeaf Magazine in 3D form. This interdisciplinary group exhibition features artists Fong Ki Wan, Jana Ghalayini, Khanh Tudo, L Akhter, Qirou Yang, Ramolen Laruan, Rice Water Collective (Florence Yee & Arezu Salamzadeh), Sanna Wani, Tommy Truong, with an exhibition essay from atif m. khan.

<p>Featuring work by Nabil Azab, Rixt de Boer, and Christian Vistan, Written in Water offers artworks that consider the processes of memory, recollection, and forgetting. 

	<p>Aristotle distinguishes memory and remembering by assigning pathos to the former and attributing deliberate action to the latter. At the heart of this distinction we might discern the nascent refutation of a linear reading of time, instead understanding the two as working radially to interpret events and experiences. The artists in this exhibition propose misalignments and fallibility within experiences of remembering. The authority of the past desanctified into phantasmata, what feels familiar also dapples in sway. A glint, a glyph, gripping onto the sticky nodes of associations. By and by, memory’s finger curls within the nook. A bed of moss and weeds envelop its trace.

<p>In “Ain El Karma”, a song originally written and performed in the early 1900s, poet and singer Aissa Djarmouni connects the act of tattooing to the land he wrote of, describing the puncturing of the skin, “Dot by dot like a baby gazelle grazing in the plain of the Olive River”. 

<p>The lasting popularity of this lyric links the once common practice of tattooing to the present; giving life and persistence to a tradition that, with the criminalizing of nomadic ways of being and the growing stigma associated with tattooing, is no longer widely performed in the region. 

<p>Mehran Mafi Bordbar, Mélika Hashemi and Iman Lahroussi draw from tattoo cultures across Iran and the Maghreb to explore borders, gender, faith, and the future—especially futures which demand the rejection of binaries, static history, and erasure.

<p>(Re)membering and (Re)imagining: the Joyous Star Peoples of Turtle Island is a solo exhibition at Hearth Garage by Natalie King addressing joy, love, power, reclamation and the (re)imagining of Anishinaabe futures. Reflecting on Anishinaabe stories of the stars and the practice of oral storytelling, King visualises the act of embarking on ancestor-to-ancestor conversations that exist within and beyond the current physical plane, queering real and imagined conversations of past and future.

<p>Natalie King (she/her) is a queer interdisciplinary Anishinaabe artist, facilitator and member of Timiskaming First Nation. King's multidisciplinary arts practice includes video, painting, sculpture and installation as well as community engagement, curation and arts administration.

<i><p>Deeply connected to human projections and aspirations, the Moon is subject to an array of encounters – from personal wonder to our collective histories, of bodies of water and flesh.
Following the line between waking hours and sleep, two subterranean rooms refract along the asymmetrical warp of the scrying bowl. Step towards inversion or clarity; there are still pools to welcome you near the cyclical turn of seasons pinned to canvas. Choose another way to find yourself within a labyrinthine corridor, following scorched bronze and quilts in rest. These twin chambers hinge on the reading room, a restful moth-light library; we invite you to sit a spell by the glow.</p></i>

<p>Due to current Lockdown restrictions in Ontario, there will not be regular gallery hours. For more information please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com or info@theplumb.ca

		<br>Cody Caetano x Yan Wen Chang</span>
<p><img src="../img/SLA_6.jpg" style="width:65%;">

<p>We’re excited to share the newest edition of our City Water broadside, <i>Shadow Land Acknowledgment”</i>, a collaboration between Cody Caetano and Yan Wen Chang.⁣
⁣
<p>"The idea and conceptual site of the Shadow Land comes from writer and traditional teacher Lee Maracle (Sto:lo), who in the past has taught it as “the space between the living and the dead where terrible things can be looked at.” ⁣
⁣
<p>In “Shadow Land Acknowledgement,” Yan Wen Chang and Cody Caetano torque a political genre to confront the myopia and cognitive dissonance of the city’s political shakers. ⁣⁣
⁣
<p>B&W prints of this edition, as pictured, are available for free/by donation, while the edition of 20 originals is for sale for $45 each. <b>For inquiries please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com. All proceeds from this broadside will go to Encampment Support Network Toronto.</b>

	<br>Travellers: A New Installation by Jordan Elliot Prosser</span>
	<p>January 16th - February 16th, 2021

<p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ-wJJdI3lM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Over the Christmas season, Jordan Elliott Prosser has recycled material from a recent exhibition to transform Hearth into a diorama, inviting visitors to peer into a sculptural tableau made from Prosser’s childhood objects . Travellers is conceived in the image of the Christian trope of a redemptive interior found in representations of the nativity and persisting in western literature (Dickens), cinema (Spielberg), and visual art (Duchamp).

<p>This exhibition is intended to be viewed from Hearth’s window, and is available for viewing at any time. It is best viewed after the sun has set on a snowy day. We are located on Ulster St. just east of Three Star Variety (621 Bathurst, Toronto, ON, M5S 2R2). For more information, see hearthgarage.com or contact us at hearthgarage@gmail.com.
