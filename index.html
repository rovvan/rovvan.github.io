<img src="../img/Moonshow.jpg" style="width:50%;">

<p>Moonshow
<br>ft. work by FASTW√úRMS, Holly Fedida, Julian Yi-Jong Hou, Chantal Khoury, Aidan Koch, Alicia Nauta, Shaelynn Recollet, Fatine-Violette Sabiri,  and V√©ronique Sunatori 
<br>January 9 - February 7, 2021
<br>A seasonal collaboration with <A HREF="https://theplumb.ca" style="color:black">the plumb</A>

<p>Deeply connected to human projections and aspirations, the Moon is subject to an array of encounters ‚Äì from personal wonder to our collective histories, of bodies of water and flesh.
Following the line between waking hours and sleep, two subterranean rooms refract along the asymmetrical warp of the scrying bowl. Step towards inversion or clarity; there are still pools to welcome you near the cyclical turn of seasons pinned to canvas. Choose another way to find yourself within a labyrinthine corridor, following scorched bronze and quilts in rest. These twin chambers hinge on the reading room, a restful moth-light library; we invite you to sit a spell by the glow.

<p>For more information about viewings please email us at hearthgarage@gmail.com

<p>Hearth and the plumb are committed to the safety of all our friends and collaborators and have a full document outlining our Health & Safety Measures in response to COVID-19. This guide can be sent to anyone upon request.
