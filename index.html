<br>Bodily Dreams Workshop with Jenny Laiwint
<br>in association with the exhibition<b><A HREF="pages/dreams.html" style="color:black">places where sounds turn to dreams...</A></b>
<br>November 24, 2:30-4:30pm
<br>Sign up <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesI7WPbz8DpT2Jyvoiv-jaOtgCux8nGX19XZFzsD-YisIULA/viewform" style="color:black"> here </A>

<p>This workshop will take place at Hearth, located near the corner of Bathurst & Ulster, on Wednesday November 24th from 2:30-4:30pm. 

<p>Participants are encouraged to dress prepared for the weather. We ask that all participants be prepared to show proof of vaccination and/or valid exemption prior to the start of the workshop, to ensure the safety of all participants and the artist. An email confirming your participation will be sent to all participants prior to the workshop. Participants signing up should be available for the duration of the workshop. 

<p>Workshop description: 
<br>Artist Jennifer Laiwint’s interactive workshop forges connections between bodily rhythms and feeling states and explores the ways that these can be creatively translated through movement, sound, drawing and creative visualizations. What happens to our physical rhythms when we attempt to overcome fear or enter a meditative trance? How can the interpretation of these tempos and their variations be a point of entry into movement creation, speculative storytelling and beat making? 

<p>Inspired by footage of cardiologist Dr. John Grammer demonstrating different arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) through simple movements, Laiwint adapts Grammar’s embodied method to develop an approach to listening and imagining bodily beats that individuals at all levels of experience can engage. For this workshop, internal listening forms the basis for relational dance-based games, drawing exercises and beat making. Since Covid-19, Laiwint has developed alternate listening activities based on imagining and touching sounds and pulses. These exercises will focus on both the rhythmic, visual and emotional dimensions of bodily sounds. Participants will engage in different modes of translation based on what is heard when listening to the body and their imaginations to generate movement, recorded sound, and sharing what might be found in a warehouse rave, a mystical sanctuary or an experimental research lab.

<p>What to bring: 
<br>For the workshop, participants will need to bring a pen and paper/notebook for sketching, and are also encouraged to download the free app NOISE by Roli (though this is optional), prior to coming to the workshop. 

<p>Artist bio: 
<br>Jennifer Laiwint (she/her) is a Tkaronto based interdisciplinary artist and DJ, also known as Hadara. Her practice is grounded in a collaborative approach with a focus on merging the worlds of contemporary and nightclub dance forms, experimental sound and video art. Jennifer's current work is guided by a curiosity about what can be heard in the body during transformative states, and how dance can mediate connections between physical rhythms, electronic music and psycho-spiritual practices. She has developed work at the Banff Centre and NARS Foundation in New York and has presented in galleries and festivals such as Xpace, the Art Gallery of Mississauga and SummerWorks. In 2020, Jennifer was accepted into the Dancemakers Peer Learning Network and the DOC Breakthrough Program to develop new projects in the fields of dance and documentary film. She recently participated in the TO Community Love-In “Practice Lab” series and presented new video work for Long Winter Television and the plumb gallery. Jennifer is also a board member at Pleasure Dome, where she recently curated “Measures of Motion,” a program of experimental dance films. Jennifer is currently an MFA candidate in the department of Film at York University and will be participating in Toronto Dance Theatre's Pilot Episode Program.

<p>Please join us for the opening reception of our final exhibition of the season, curated by our curatorial incubator recipient, Dhvani Ramanujam!

<p><i>places where sounds turn to dreams...</i> is a group exhibition that focuses on artists that engage with sonic-worldmaking in their practices. Through a series of aural mediations, landscapes, and ecologies, the works on display ask viewers to consider how sound helps us locate the cracks and leaks in time and space, playing with themes of speculation, language, and memory.

<br><b>Zona de Sacrificio</b>
<br>Soledad Fátima Muñoz 
<br>Sept. 15 - Oct 17th, 2021 - No Gallery Hours October 10 & 11th (Thanksgiving)

<p>Join us Friday September 17th 5-8pm for the opening day. Regular Gallery Hours are Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 12-4, and by appointment. 

<p><i>Zona de Sacrificio</i> (Sacrifice Zone) is a solo exhibition by artist and researcher Soledad Fátima Muñoz featuring a selection of textiles and a short film, supplemented with an educational iPad displaying information from https://www.desiertodememorias.cl.  

<p>Zona de Sacrificio references an ongoing process of political intervention orchestrated by North American and European governments in order to profit from resource extraction globally, leaving impacted areas permanently damaged by heavy environmental alterations and economic divestment. With works referencing events related to the history of neoliberal intervention in Chile, as well as the ongoing nature of these systemic abuses, Zona de Sacrificio aims to raise awareness of Canada’s role in global resource exploitation, and draw attention to Chile’s current context, where political prisoners still await trial for involvement in a contemporary movement to change the constitution implemented by Augusto Pinochet’s american-backed military dictatorship (1973-1990).

<p>Aguas Libres (Free Waters) amplifies the status of water as a human right, in a context where private industries have created a water crisis by allocating the majority of Chile’s water supply towards industry and agriculture. The Canadian Teacher’s Pension Plan is the majority shareholder in Chile’s private water supply, a resource that was privatized under Pinochet’s government through a 1980 Constitution heavily influenced by the neoliberal policies imported through University of Chicago operatives. During a time marked by a decade-long drought exacerbated by climate change, the Canadian Teacher’s Pension Plan has a direct hand in how Chilean people are denied access to Chilean water. 

<p>Caravana de la Muerte (The Caravan of Death) is a 17 meter long woven copper work featuring portraits memorializing victims murdered during The Caravan of Death, named for an Army death squad that executed military detainees following the Chilean coup of 1973. Following the exhibition, this work will be shipped to Chile to be installed at a memory site associated with these events. 

<p>The short film La Parte de Atrás de la Arpillera (The back of the Arpillera), 23 minutes, explores the history of the Arpillera textile as a symbol of resistance and method of documenting, denouncing, and amplifying experiences absent from a mainstream national Chilean narrative. 

<p>“Through the collection of personal histories - in the form of interviews (in-person and online), phone recordings and personal footage - filmed or sent to us by makers in Lo hermida, La Patagonia, Los Andes, Coquimbo, La Serena, Malmö, Chicago and Toronto, we wanted to make a piece that - like the Arpillera - contained the history of resistance of our ancestors and peers.” -  La Parte de Atrás de la Arpillera

<p>Artist's Bio:

<p>Soledad Fátima Muñoz is an interdisciplinary artist, cultural worker and researcher born in her family’s exile in Canada and raised in Rancagua, Chile. Her work seeks to explore the ever-changing social spaces we inhabit and the archival properties of cloth. Through the investigation of the materiality of sound and the understanding of the woven structure as the continuation of our interconnected social gesture, her practice seeks to fabricate embodied instances that participate in the construction of a more equitable society and the creation of new archives of resistance.

<p>In 2014 she started Genero, an audio project/label that focuses on the distribution and representation of women and non-binary artists within the sound realm. Subsequently, in 2017, she co-founded CURRENT "Feminist Electronic Art Symposium and Mentorship,” a multidisciplinary, electronic art program working with women, non-binary, and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour) artists in Canada and beyond. Her latest collaborative audiovisual project entitled “La Parte de Atras de la Arpillera'' features a collection of interviews with Chilean textile workers whose experiences stitch together the country’s history of resistance.

<p>She studied Film at Universidad ARCIS in Santiago Chile, has a Diploma in Textile Arts from Capilano University in North Vancouver Canada, a Bachelor in Fine Arts Degree from Emily Carr University of Arts + Design in Vancouver and a Master in Fine Arts from the Department of Fiber and Material Studies of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Soledad has been the recipient of several awards, including the City of Vancouver Mayor’s Arts Award for Emerging Artist, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago New Artist Society Full Merit Scholarship, the Emily Carr University of Art + Design President’s Media Award and most recently the Textile Society of America Student and New Professionals Award.

<p>Joy is sometimes fleeting and nebulous. It is sometimes outlined or overshadowed by grief, sorrow, and deep loneliness. Yet, it continues to glimmer in small ways, especially powerful when nurtured through community care. In the spirit of precarious joy, a joy that is obtained by a communal asking, the artists in this exhibition activate joy as resistance, joy as radical acts.

<p>Produced by Project 40 Collective, "Precarious Joy" is our final volume of LooseLeaf Magazine in 3D form. This interdisciplinary group exhibition features artists Fong Ki Wan, Jana Ghalayini, Khanh Tudo, L Akhter, Qirou Yang, Ramolen Laruan, Rice Water Collective (Florence Yee & Arezu Salamzadeh), Sanna Wani, Tommy Truong, with an exhibition essay from atif m. khan.
Precarious Joy is funded by the Toronto Arts Council.

<p>Featuring work by Nabil Azab, Rixt de Boer, and Christian Vistan, Written in Water offers artworks that consider the processes of memory, recollection, and forgetting. 

	<p>Aristotle distinguishes memory and remembering by assigning pathos to the former and attributing deliberate action to the latter. At the heart of this distinction we might discern the nascent refutation of a linear reading of time, instead understanding the two as working radially to interpret events and experiences. The artists in this exhibition propose misalignments and fallibility within experiences of remembering. The authority of the past desanctified into phantasmata, what feels familiar also dapples in sway. A glint, a glyph, gripping onto the sticky nodes of associations. By and by, memory’s finger curls within the nook. A bed of moss and weeds envelop its trace.

<p>In “Ain El Karma”, a song originally written and performed in the early 1900s, poet and singer Aissa Djarmouni connects the act of tattooing to the land he wrote of, describing the puncturing of the skin, “Dot by dot like a baby gazelle grazing in the plain of the Olive River”. 

<p>The lasting popularity of this lyric links the once common practice of tattooing to the present; giving life and persistence to a tradition that, with the criminalizing of nomadic ways of being and the growing stigma associated with tattooing, is no longer widely performed in the region. 

<p>Mehran Mafi Bordbar, Mélika Hashemi and Iman Lahroussi draw from tattoo cultures across Iran and the Maghreb to explore borders, gender, faith, and the future—especially futures which demand the rejection of binaries, static history, and erasure.

<i><p>Deeply connected to human projections and aspirations, the Moon is subject to an array of encounters – from personal wonder to our collective histories, of bodies of water and flesh.
Following the line between waking hours and sleep, two subterranean rooms refract along the asymmetrical warp of the scrying bowl. Step towards inversion or clarity; there are still pools to welcome you near the cyclical turn of seasons pinned to canvas. Choose another way to find yourself within a labyrinthine corridor, following scorched bronze and quilts in rest. These twin chambers hinge on the reading room, a restful moth-light library; we invite you to sit a spell by the glow.</p></i>

<p>We’re excited to share the newest edition of our City Water broadside, <i>Shadow Land Acknowledgment”</i>, a collaboration between Cody Caetano and Yan Wen Chang.⁣
⁣
<p>"The idea and conceptual site of the Shadow Land comes from writer and traditional teacher Lee Maracle (Sto:lo), who in the past has taught it as “the space between the living and the dead where terrible things can be looked at.” ⁣
⁣
<p>In “Shadow Land Acknowledgement,” Yan Wen Chang and Cody Caetano torque a political genre to confront the myopia and cognitive dissonance of the city’s political shakers. ⁣⁣
⁣
<p>B&W prints of this edition, as pictured, are available for free/by donation, while the edition of 20 originals is for sale for $45 each. <b>For inquiries please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com. All proceeds from this broadside will go to Encampment Support Network Toronto.</b>

<p>Over the Christmas season, Jordan Elliott Prosser has recycled material from a recent exhibition to transform Hearth into a diorama, inviting visitors to peer into a sculptural tableau made from Prosser’s childhood objects . Travellers is conceived in the image of the Christian trope of a redemptive interior found in representations of the nativity and persisting in western literature (Dickens), cinema (Spielberg), and visual art (Duchamp).

<p>This exhibition is intended to be viewed from Hearth’s window, and is available for viewing at any time. It is best viewed after the sun has set on a snowy day.
