<p>Erotic Awakenings
<br>Hearth x Fan Wu</p>

‚Ä®<p>We are creating an archive of erotic awakenings.

<p>We use <i>erotic</i> to name the energy that forges loose links between love, sex, romance, play, flirtation, lust; the erotic is associative by nature, and rejoices in eluding capture by definition.

<p>We take an <i>awakening</i> to mean a moment when you felt your erotic landscape shift: perhaps you were inducted into <i>eros</i> for the first time; or, later in life, the parameters of your sexuality expanded to include new scenes, new feelings, or new objects of desire.

<p> ‚ÄúEros is an issue of boundaries.‚Äù Anne Carson, <i>Eros the Bittersweet</i>. And the <i>erotic awakening</i> is an awakening of oneself to one‚Äôs own boundaries, the problem of their instability, and the pleasures of their maintenance.¬†

<p>There are times where the tides of attraction produce a gravity between us and something in the world in a way that presupposes understanding. Why now, and why those things?

<p>I mean, we never know why. But the erotic awakening captures confusion before interpretation.

<p>An erotic awakening arises from innocent situations as much as from those explicitly sexually charged. Because nothing is intrinsically innocent, or intrinsically erotic; the way our spirit moves toward the thing, and the way the thing moves toward our spirit, forges eroticism. An erotic awakening is a story you tell about yourself from a memory, further encrusted with significance every time you remember it.¬†

<p><b>We want to hear your narratives</b>, and how you look back to those supercharged moments from the vantage point of the <i>now</i>.

<p>Should you decide that you‚Äôd like to share an awakening of your own, we invite you to get in touch. Writing doesn‚Äôt need to be signed with a recognizable name either; the agency of what you call yourself is important to us.

<p><i>Erotic awakenings</i> are sensitive things to speak of; but we believe there are oft-occluded truths within this sensitivity, and all kinds of delight we can bask in by speaking of them. We invite any kind of writing at all on the erotic: pure descriptions, or description mixed with interpretations; tiny haikus, or long screeds.

<p>Thank you for reading, and thank you for sharing.</p>
