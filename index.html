<br><A HREF="pages/starpeoples.html" style="color:black">(Re)membering and (Re)imagining: the Joyous Star Peoples of Turtle Island</A>
<br>A Solo Project by Natalie King
<br>April 19 - May 27, 2021
<br> <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/events/1125915761219510/?active_tab=about" style="color:black">See FB Event to RSVP</A>

<p><img src="../img/nat_king.jpg" style="width:70%;">
<p>(Re)membering and (Re)imagining: the Joyous Star Peoples of Turtle Island is a solo exhibition at Hearth Garage by Natalie King addressing joy, love, power, reclamation and the (re)imagining of Anishinaabe futures. Reflecting on Anishinaabe stories of the stars and the practice of oral storytelling, King visualises the act of embarking on ancestor-to-ancestor conversations that exist within and beyond the current physical plane, queering real and imagined conversations of past and future.

<p>Natalie King (she/her) is a queer interdisciplinary Anishinaabe artist, facilitator and member of Timiskaming First Nation. King's multidisciplinary arts practice includes video, painting, sculpture and installation as well as community engagement, curation and arts administration.

<p>In “Ain El Karma”, a song originally written and performed in the early 1900s, poet and singer Aissa Djarmouni connects the act of tattooing to the land he wrote of, describing the puncturing of the skin, “Dot by dot like a baby gazelle grazing in the plain of the Olive River”. 

<p>The lasting popularity of this lyric links the once common practice of tattooing to the present; giving life and persistence to a tradition that, with the criminalizing of nomadic ways of being and the growing stigma associated with tattooing, is no longer widely performed in the region. 

<p>Mehran Mafi Bordbar, Mélika Hashemi and Iman Lahroussi draw from tattoo cultures across Iran and the Maghreb to explore borders, gender, faith, and the future—especially futures which demand the rejection of binaries, static history, and erasure.

<i><p>Deeply connected to human projections and aspirations, the Moon is subject to an array of encounters – from personal wonder to our collective histories, of bodies of water and flesh.
Following the line between waking hours and sleep, two subterranean rooms refract along the asymmetrical warp of the scrying bowl. Step towards inversion or clarity; there are still pools to welcome you near the cyclical turn of seasons pinned to canvas. Choose another way to find yourself within a labyrinthine corridor, following scorched bronze and quilts in rest. These twin chambers hinge on the reading room, a restful moth-light library; we invite you to sit a spell by the glow.</p></i>

<p>Due to current Lockdown restrictions in Ontario, there will not be regular gallery hours. For more information please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com or info@theplumb.ca

		<br>Cody Caetano x Yan Wen Chang</span>
<p><img src="../img/SLA_6.jpg" style="width:65%;">

<p>We’re excited to share the newest edition of our City Water broadside, <i>Shadow Land Acknowledgment”</i>, a collaboration between Cody Caetano and Yan Wen Chang.⁣
⁣
<p>"The idea and conceptual site of the Shadow Land comes from writer and traditional teacher Lee Maracle (Sto:lo), who in the past has taught it as “the space between the living and the dead where terrible things can be looked at.” ⁣
⁣
<p>In “Shadow Land Acknowledgement,” Yan Wen Chang and Cody Caetano torque a political genre to confront the myopia and cognitive dissonance of the city’s political shakers. ⁣⁣
⁣
<p>B&W prints of this edition, as pictured, are available for free/by donation, while the edition of 20 originals is for sale for $45 each. <b>For inquiries please contact hearthgarage@gmail.com. All proceeds from this broadside will go to Encampment Support Network Toronto.</b>

	<br>Travellers: A New Installation by Jordan Elliot Prosser</span>
	<p>January 16th - February 16th, 2021

<p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ-wJJdI3lM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Over the Christmas season, Jordan Elliott Prosser has recycled material from a recent exhibition to transform Hearth into a diorama, inviting visitors to peer into a sculptural tableau made from Prosser’s childhood objects . Travellers is conceived in the image of the Christian trope of a redemptive interior found in representations of the nativity and persisting in western literature (Dickens), cinema (Spielberg), and visual art (Duchamp).

<p>This exhibition is intended to be viewed from Hearth’s window, and is available for viewing at any time. It is best viewed after the sun has set on a snowy day. We are located on Ulster St. just east of Three Star Variety (621 Bathurst, Toronto, ON, M5S 2R2). For more information, see hearthgarage.com or contact us at hearthgarage@gmail.com.
