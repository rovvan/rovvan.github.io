<title>About</title>
<p> A structural element in the makeup of a house, a marker of human intervention, and a tool providing warmth, light, and food, a hearth gathers us towards itself, and towards each other.</p>

<p> Founded in 2019 as an artist-run space, Hearth seeks to provide a place in which artists, writers, curators, and community organizers can present projects within a context that values gathering, collaboration, experimentation, and community. Presenting exhibitions, screenings, performances, and workshops with criticality, joy, and curiosity as map and motivator, Hearth aims to provide a reprieve from limitations imposed by many larger artistic operating bodies, and the limiting factors of the city itself.</p>

<p>Hearth is committed to working towards an anti-oppressive, queer positive environment, welcoming marginalized, racialized and indigenous folks through programming that celebrates the work of a diverse range of emerging collaborators.
