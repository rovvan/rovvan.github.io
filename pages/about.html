<p>A structural element in the makeup of a house, and a tool providing warmth, light, and food; a hearth gathers us towards itself, and towards each other.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019 as an artist-run space, Hearth seeks to provide a site for artists, writers, curators, and community organizers to present projects within a context that values collaboration, experimentation, and community. In presenting exhibitions, screenings, performances, and workshops, Hearth aims to provide a reprieve from limitations imposed by many larger artistic operating bodies, and the city itself.</p>

<p>Hearth is committed to working towards an anti-oppressive, queer positive environment, and welcoming marginalized, racialized, and indigenous folks through programming that celebrates the work of a diverse range of emerging collaborators.
 </p>

 <p>All programming collaboratively produced by: Rowan Lynch, Sameen Mahboubi, Philip Ocampo, and Benjamin de Boer.
