    <p>
     <i>places where sounds turn to dreams...</i> is a group exhibition that focuses on artists that engage with sonic-worldmaking in their practices. Through a series of aural mediations, landscapes, and ecologies, the works on display ask viewers to consider how sound helps us locate the cracks and leaks in time and space, playing with themes of speculation, language, and memory.

      <p>Gallery Hours will be held Sundays and Mondays, 12PM - 4PM during the run of the exhibition. 
<br>
<br>If you cannot make these gallery hours, and would like to visit between Monday to Saturday, feel free to get in touch at hearthgarage@gmail.com or DM @hearth.garage on instagram.
