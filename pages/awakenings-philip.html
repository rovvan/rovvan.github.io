<p><br><i><b>Hit Pause</i> by 0campop005</b></p>

<p>So I played Super Smash Bros. Melee a lot when I was a kid, which wasn’t uncommon considering how every boy my age played it back then and how popular the game was in general

<p>The game has this really unique pause menu that freezes all the fighters mid battle and gives the player the ability to move around the frame on different axes

<p> (You could also do the same thing with the in-game collectible trophies).

<p>I remember this one time 

<p>I was playing with a friend and seeing him hit the pause button to look underneath Princess Peach’s dress which I thought was pretty interesting because the developers did bother to give the character model an undergarment 

<p>and gave players the ability to potentially look at those undergarments (as <i>if</i> Nintendo didn’t know that their target demographic were teenage boys)

<p>Didn’t get me going in the same way it got him going though

<p>But out of curiosity one night I booted up the game and started a match with some of the male characters. 

<p>Marth and Roy from <i>Fire Emblem</i> and Link from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> all wore tunics which I, at the time, thought were kind of close enough to skirts?
 
<p>I was like, 

<p><i>hm maybe the developers put some detail into their underskirts too?</i>

<p>Because <i>I guess I’d be into that?</i> 

<p>I tossed Captain Falcon in here as well because his clothes were always so tight and I always really <i>appreciated</i> it.

<p>And I was so fucking hot for these CGI bulges!!!! that probably weren’t actually anything significant or intentional at all but I just remember just sitting there and staring for hours not knowing what my body was doing or what was going on. 

<p>Glossy-eyed, dick hard, with my drooling mouth wide open; so began one of the most formative activities I’d partake in as a kid. 

<p>It was silly 
<br>but it was also a way to explore the queerness I wouldn’t be able to put into words till I was much older. 

<p>AKA I had no idea I was gay

<p>Just loved video games
  
<p>and video game bulges.....
