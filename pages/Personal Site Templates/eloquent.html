<p>Eloquent Systems is an exhibition highlighting video and object based work focused on the idea of the city, as inspired by research into the Situationists International and contemporary urban life. It was on view from April 8 - 16th, 2017 in the Anniversary Gallery at OCADU. The exhibition is named for the corporation that offers content management software for archives, libraries, museums, and records as a reference to the structures that underlie how information formally concerning the city is organized and distributed.</p>
