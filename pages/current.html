	<p>New Strata, November 23 - December 28, 2019</p> 
	<p>Opening: November 23, 7-10PM</p>
	<p> ft. <b> Misbah Ahmed, Shannon Garden-Smith, Andrew Harding, and Cadence Planthara. </b></p>
	<p> View exhibition package <A HREF="../pages/New_Strata_Package.html" style="color:black">here</A>.</p>
 
	<p> Hearth draws its name from the interaction of fire and earth. Works within the opening exhibition embrace fire‚Äôs generative potential as much as its destructive qualities, engaging with their surrounding architecture to provide anchoring points around which visitors may orient themselves.</p>

<p> New Strata references the process of stratification with respect to its social, scientific, and metaphorical associations. By examining the layering of geological features, stratification can deliver information concerning the relations between objects and time. As the first exhibition to take place on site, New Strata
itself demonstrates a layer of activity and relations, with the intention of serving as an introduction to a space working toward artistic community, collaboration, and experimentation in the city of Toronto. <p>
 
	<p> HOURS and LOCATION</p>
